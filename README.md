An example project built with [pybind11][] and [scikit-build-core][]. Python
3.7+ (see older commits for older versions of Python using [scikit-build (classic)][]).

## Installation

- Clone this repository
- `pip install ./scikit_build_example`

## Test call

```python
import scikit_build_example

scikit_build_example.add(1, 2)
```

## Files

This example has several files that are a good idea, but aren't strictly
necessary. The necessary files are:

* `pyproject.toml`: The Python project file
* `CMakeLists.txt`: The CMake configuration file
* `src/main.cpp`: The source file for the C++ build
* `src/scikit_build_example/__init__.py`: The Python portion of the module. The root of the module needs to be `<package_name>`, `src/<package_name>`, or `python/<package_name>` to be auto-discovered.

These files are also expected and highly recommended:

* `.gitignore`: Git's ignore list, also used by `scikit-build-core` to select files for the SDist
* `README.md`: The source for the PyPI description
* `LICENSE`: The license file

There are also several completely optional directories:

* `.github`: configuration for [Dependabot][] and [GitHub Actions][]
* `conda.recipe`: Example recipe. Normally you should submit projects to conda-forge instead of building them yourself, but this is useful for testing the example.
* `docs/`: Documentation
* `tests/`: Tests go here

And some optional files:

* `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Configuration for the fantastic static-check runner [pre-commit][].
* `noxfile.py`: Configuration for the [nox][] task runner, which helps make setup easier for contributors.

This is a simplified version of the recommendations in the [Scientific-Python
Development Guide][], which is a _highly_ recommended read for anyone
interested in Python package development (Scientific or not). The guide also
has a cookiecutter that includes scikit-build-core and pybind11 as a backend
choice.

### CI Examples

There are examples for CI in `.github/workflows`. A simple way to produces
binary "wheels" for all platforms is illustrated in the "wheels.yml" file,
using [cibuildwheel][].
